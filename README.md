## About the Video Course
Kotlin is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications, allowing web developers to write expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks and providing a smooth learning curve. This video is a start-to-finish walkthrough of the topics most critical to anyone building a new web application. Whether keeping your application secure, connecting to your database, enabling token-based authentication, or developing Restful APIs, this video has you covered. You'll learn how to use Gradle with Kotlin and integrate it with Webpack, ECMAScript 8, and React to create elegant UIs for your web applications. You'll learn about routing requests and implementing SSL. Moving on, you'll get to know about best practices to keep user data safe. Finally you'll learn how to deploy your application on the cloud. By the end of the video, you will be able to build robust, secure, and fully-featured applications for the web.
